      <p>Important notes:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The College of Letters and Science requires you to maintain 13 units each semester. If you have received approval
      from the College for a <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/faq/enroll13.html">reduced course load</a>, you must maintain
      the number of units for which you have been approved.</li>
      <li>If you are a current degree candidate and will graduate at the end of this term, you must visit us in
      <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/3dmap/3dmap.shtml?evans">206 Evans Hall</a> for approval to go below 13 units.</li>
      <li>If you believe our records are inaccurate, please contact the college advising office at (510) 642-1483.</li>

      excess_units = <<-EOS
      <p>Your registration has been blocked for next term by the College of Letters & Science because you have exceeded the
      maximum number semesters and/or units allowed. By the end of this semester, you will have completed eight or more semesters
      and exceeded 130 units. Until this block is cleared, you <strong>cannot</strong> enroll in classes for the next term. If you are not
      enrolled in classes, you will not be an officially registered student. You must be an officially registered student to use
      campus services (e.g. libraries, health services, recreational sports facilities, Class Pass bus travel, Career Center, etc.),
      receive final grades, or obtain official campus transcripts.</p>
      <p>The College limits students to eight semesters of enrollment including all institutions attended, or enrollment through
      the semester in which students exceed 130 units, whichever comes last. For the purpose of calculating the total units and
      terms you have completed, summer session is not considered a semester and high school enrichment units are not included.</p>
      <p>Next steps:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>If you intend to graduate at the end of this term, please visit
      <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/3dmap/3dmap.shtml?evans">206 Evans Hall</a> and declare your candidacy.</li>
      <li>Contact us if you would like to meet with an adviser to discuss the options you have to complete your degree.</li>

      <p>Your registration has been blocked for next term by the College of Letters & Science because you have declared as a

      <p>Next steps:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>No action is required.</li>
      <li>This is a standard block on your record as an approved double major that is placed against the semester following
      your final eligible semester, and will restrict you from enrolling in classes for the next term.  Reference
